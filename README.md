## 🌟 Key Features

1. 📝 **Quill WYSIWYG Editor**: Replace generic textareas with a rich-text toolbar allowing headers, bold/italics/underlines, lists, links, and inline text formatting.
2. 👁️ **Live Responsive Preview**: Real-time side-by-side card rendering variables (like `{{company_name}}` and `{{contact_person}}`) to show the user exactly what the recipient sees.
3. 📥 **Excel Lead Import**: Parse and validate `.xlsx` and `.xls` lists. Handles blank rows, duplicate emails, and logs import status.
4. 📎 **Template Attachments**: Upload attachments (PDFs, spreadsheets, images, up to 10MB) stored in the database as binary blobs and sent with the template.
5. 🛡️ **XSS Protection**: Uses **Jsoup HTML Sanitizer** to filter templates and protect against script injections while keeping safe CSS styling intact.
6. 🔑 **SMTP Cryptography**: Encrypts password credentials with AES inside the database. Connection health is tested via AJAX APIs.
7. 🚦 **Anti-Spam Controls**: In-memory locking prevents concurrent scheduler overlaps (double-sending). Includes randomized wait intervals between emails.
8. 🌙 **Persistent Dark Mode**: Premium glassmorphism layout that toggles themes and saves states locally.
9. 📊 **Performance Reports**: Generates campaign analysis, exportable directly to PDF, Excel, or CSV.

## 🏗️ Clean Layered Architecture

To achieve high maintainability and security, the backend is organized into five decoupled layers:

```mermaid
graph TD
    Controller[1. Web Controller Layer] --> Service[2. Database State & Coordination Service]
    Service --> MailService[3. Dynamic SMTP Mail Service]
    Service --> TemplateProcessor[4. Placeholders & Variables Processor]
    Service --> HtmlRenderer[5. Markdown Parser & HTML Sanitizer]
```

- **Controller**: Manages user input, REST endpoints, and form validation flows.
- **Service**: Processes business logic constraints (e.g. checking lead counts, encrypting credentials, or scheduling).
- **MailService**: Manages network configurations, sockets, connection timeouts, and mail message construction.
- **TemplateProcessor**: Dynamically swaps placeholder tokens (`{{company_name}}`, `{{contact_person}}`, `{{name}}`, `{{team}}`, `{{sender}}`) in content.
- **HTML Renderer**: Processes markdown syntax (like `# Headers` and `**Bold**`) and sanitizes text against XSS using Jsoup.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Database Setup
Make sure you have a local MySQL server running. Connect to your database server and execute:
```sql
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS cold_email_automation;
```
*(Hibernate's `ddl-auto=update` configuration will automatically generate all table schemas, indexes, and relations when the application starts).*

### 2. Configure Environment Properties
The application database credentials can be customized in `src/main/resources/application.properties`:

```

### 3. Run the Application
Open your terminal in the project `/demo` root directory and run:
```powershell
mvn spring-boot:run
```
